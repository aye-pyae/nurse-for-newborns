				Babies brains are, quite simply, awesome. They are born ready to learn. But nature alone won’t stimulate this spectacular brain development. It’s the combination of genetics and the infant’s experiences that build the foundational structure of their brain, upon which all future learning depends.

				<h2> Why playing is important for newborns ? </h2>
				<p>	
					Play is the chief way that infants learn how to move, communicate, socialize, and understand their surroundings. It is through play that your child will develop essential life skills, learn how to interact with peers and with adults, discover creativity, adapt and develop new skills, and also learn a whole range of emotions.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Play has a vital role in your child's mental and physical development, and as a parent, you must realize your responsibility in creating opportunities for your child to play. Babies and young children learn much from playing, and these activities help them develop valuable skills which they will need later on in life.

				<h2> How does newborns learn form play ? </h2>
				<p>	
					Babies learn through experience and observation. They rely on all their senses as they explore their surroundings which is why our nursery rooms are rich in colours and textures, sights and sounds. And during the first month of life, your baby will learn by interacting with you. Beyond their five senses babies also need to develop body awareness and balance, so we spend time on the floor with them - rolling, crawling, climbing and cruising – helping them to move independently and build their sensory systems.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The first thing your baby will learn is to connect the feel of your touch, the sound of your voice, and the sight of your face with getting his or her needs for comfort and food met.Even at this young age, newborns are ready to learn about the world around them. Your newborn loves to look your face. Newborns can recognize and respond to mom or dad's voice (or other interesting sounds) by looking alert and becoming less active. The baby may try to find out where the sound is coming from by looking around and turning his or her head.	Encourage learning with smiles, soothing sounds, and gentle caresses. When you smile and talk to your infant, your face and the sound of your voice will become a familiar source of calm and comfort. Your little one will learn to associate you with nourishment, warmth, and a soothing touch.
