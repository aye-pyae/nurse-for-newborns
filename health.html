			<h2> Newborns: first week of life </h2>	
			<p>
				The first week of a newborn baby is very important. Therefore, mothers should take care of the following information during the first week of their newborn baby:

						<strong> development : </strong> Newborn is learning a lot as you spend time together every day. Their brain is growing and developing as they see, hear, smell and touch the world around them.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content1-item">		
					<img src="images/baby-cry.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care">
					<p>	
						<strong> crying : </strong> If your newborn is crying, you can try feeding, changing their nappy, cuddling or rocking, speaking or singing in a soothing voice, or giving them a warm relaxing bath. And if your newborn is crying a lot, remember that it’s normal for newborns to cry. Comforting your newborn will help them feel safe and secure.					
					</p>
				</div>	

				<div class="content1-item">

					alt="Health & Daily Care">
					<p>	
						<strong> feeding & sleeping : </strong> Newborns will sleep most of the time, waking up every few hours to feed. Newborns can’t ‘sleep through the night’. They have tiny tummies, so they need to wake and feed often.
						Most newborns feed every 2-4 hours, and they have around 8-12 feeds every 24 hours. Sometimes feeds might last up to an hour, especially if your newborn is breastfeeding
					</p>

				<div class="content1-item">

					<p>	
						<strong> bonding & communicating :</strong> You can communicate with your newborn using your voice, touch, sight and smell. Gentle touch, cuddling, smiling and gazing communicates important information about your newborn’s place in the world, and helps your newborn feel safe and secure with you.During this first week, you’ll also start getting to know how your baby communicates with you using baby cues and body language.

							<strong> Don't Soak The Baby In Water :</strong>
							Though it might be tempting to give a newborn a bath in a sink or an infant tub, don’t do it. Submerging a newborn in water can damage the umbilical stump, delay healing time, and potentially cause an infection.					
						</p>
					</div>	

					<div>	
						<img src="images/warm-water.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care" class="grid_6">
						<p class="grid_6">	
							<strong> Warm Water Only : </strong> The water temperature you are using to bathe your newborn should be about 100 degree F, states Nationwide Children's. This temperature is perfect for a newborn, as it will prevent her from catching a chill and it will avoid a burn. Use a thermometer to test the water.				
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>	
						<img src="images/baby-bath1.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care" class="grid_6">
						<p class="grid_6">	
							<strong> Only Bath Every Other Day : </strong> A lot of parents are tempted to wash their newborn every day – or even several times a day. Washing your newborn too frequently actually isn’t a good thing. In fact, according to Mayo Clinic, newborns only need to be bathed about three times a week.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<img src="images/baby-bath.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care" class="grid_6">
						<p class="grid_6">	
							<strong> Use Flat Surface To Give A Bath :
							</strong> Until the newborn’s umbilical stump has fallen off and is completely healed, bathing in a sink or an infant tub should be avoided. Until that time, make sure that you always lay your little one on a flat, secure surface when you are giving her a sponge bath. It could be a counter top, a changing table, or even the floor.

						<img src="images/baby-cleaneye.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care" class="grid_6">
						<p class="grid_6">
							<strong>  Gently Clean The Eyes : </strong> Don’t forget to clean the newborn’s eyes. Dust, dirt, debris, and those cute little baby sleepies can build up around those sweet little peepers. When cleaning around the eyes, make sure that steer clear of any soap. You should only use water to cleanse this highly delicate area.

						<p class="grid_6">
							<strong> Don't Forget To Clean The Ear And The Nose : </strong> Just like every other part of the body, a newborn’s ears have to be cleaned.  This part of the body requires a bit more care when cleaning than other parts because the ears are very delicate.
							<br>
							When the nose is stuffy, eating can become difficult because they can’t breathe properly while their feeding.

							<strong> Don't Forget To Moisturize : </strong>
							A newborn’s skin is very thin, which makes it extremely fragile, sensitive, and prone to drying out. If it’s allowed to dry out, the skin can become irritated and the risk of developing eczema, a condition that causes itchy, scaly, and sometimes painful bumps, increases.

							<strong> Treat Cradle Cap With Care : </strong>	
							Parents are often alarmed when they discover that their newborn has cradle cap. It appears as scaly, yellowish-white patches on the top of the head and it often looks much worse than it actually is.

					</div>

					<div>
						<img src="images/baby-hygiene.jpg" alt="Health & Daily Care" class="grid_6">
						<p class="grid_6">
							<strong>  Practice Oral Hygiene : </strong> Even though a newborn isn’t born with teeth, that doesn’t mean that oral hygiene isn’t important. Underneath the gums lie little tooth buds, which will start emerging before you know it. Cleaning your little one’s mouth now will ensure a good foundation for healthy teeth.

							<strong> Give Manicures And Pedicures : </strong>
							Of course, a newborn can’t get a real manicure or pedicure. But mom and dad can – and should – give their little one’s manis and pedis on a regular basis.

							<strong> Have All The Supplies Ready : </strong>
							A general list of things you will need to have ready before you start your cleaning regiment include: diaper, powder, washcloths, towels, a basin of warm water, baby soap, lotion or petroleum jelly, an infant brush, a clean change of clothing, a nail file or baby nail clippers, and a ball syringe.

			<h2> Newborns: dressing </h2>
				<div>
					<h3>
						What kind of clothes should be chosen for newborns?
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Choose newborn clothes that are easy to put on and off, comfortable for baby to wear, and easy to wash.
						</li>
						<li> 
							Clothes should be <strong>comfortable, soft and easy to take care of.</strong>
						</li>						
						<li>
							Clothes made from <strong>cotton</strong> are a good choice. Cotton clothes will keep your baby cooler in hot weather than clothes made from synthetic fibres. Cotton also washes well and is gentle against your baby’s sensitive skin.
						</li>
						<li>
							Look out  clothes with a <strong>low fire hazard label</strong>. Newborn rompers and jumpsuits should have this label.
						</li>
						<li>
							Babies grow out of clothes quickly, so buy only what you need in each size.
						</li>
						<li>
							It’s a good idea to dress your baby in layers.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3> How to wash newborns clothes? </h3>
					<ol>
						<li>	
							<h4> Wash baby clothes before use </h4>
							<p>
								A very important one is to always wash new baby clothes before you dress your child in them.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li> 
							<h4> Disinfect and clean your hands	</h4>
							<p>	
								The human hand is a source of bacteria, before handling your baby’s clothes sanitize and wash your hands thoroughly.
							</p>	 
						</li>

						<li>	
							<h4> Measure the temperature of the water </h4>	
							<p>
								While washing baby clothes, it is essential to check the water temperature. 
							</p>																		
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4> Use eco-friendly,non-chemical detergent</h4>
							<p>	
								Using regular detergents could damage your baby’s skin, cause allergic reactions and maybe even cut your baby’s skin. Ensure you use a detergent that is cleared for baby skin, making it non-chemical and eco-friendly is an additional safety measure.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4> Pre-soak with soap </h4>
							<p>	
								A great way of ensuring that the clothes run a full cycle is by taking a bucket of water at the temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, adding a half cup of baby’s detergent and soaking it in there for half an hour before adding it to the machine.
							</p>	
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>  Soak before and after the wash </h4>
							<p>	 
								Bacteria can build up before a wash, to ensure you kill most bacteria, soak your baby’s clothes in hot water before a wash for 30 minutes, wash and finally soak in warm water after the wash.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>  Dry the baby clothes </h4>
							<p>	
								It is extremely important that you make sure that your baby’s clothes are completely dry. Dry in sunlight if possible but do not put damp clothes on your baby as it can cause fungal infections.
							</p>
						</li>						
						
						<li>	
							<h4> Use fabric conditioner </h4>
							<p>
								Soft fabric is better for sensitive skin. A fabric conditioner relaxes the fibers in the cloth, keeping your baby's clothing and bedding soft.								
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4> Wash cloth diapers separately </h4>
 							<p>
								Washing cloth diapers can be a complicated business. To avoid spreading germs, keep wet, soiled cloth diapers apart. Don't mix them with other clothing in the washing machine.							
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h3> 
						What clothes are best for a newborn to sleep at night? 
					</h3> 
					<p>
						Knowing how to dress a newborn for both day and night will make baby happier and healthier. It will also make diaper changes and feedings easier for mom and dad.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4> 
								Dressing Your Newborn for Cold Weather Sleep
							</h4>
							<p>
								What should a newborn wear to sleep in cooler weather? Pediatricians say that to help regulate baby’s body temperature, you need clothing that keeps baby’s arms, legs and feet covered. We think footed pajamas are an excellent choice for infants this age because of their convenient snaps and zippers. These popular garments allow you to change diapers overnight with only one hand and then quickly swap them out for fresh ones in the morning. Since your little one will be spending most of their time indoors, footed sleepers also make simple yet cute outfits for daytime play, feedings and naps. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>
								Bedtime Clothing for Warm Weather Sleep 
							</h4>
							<p>	
								If you live in a warm climate or have your baby in the spring or summer, you may want to choose pajamas snug enough to lull a newborn to sleep but lightweight enough to keep them cool. Try layering a cotton or muslin swaddle blanket on top of a short-sleeved cotton bodysuit. If your little one doesn’t like to swaddle, a cotton footed pajama will make them feel safe and secure.
