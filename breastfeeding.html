						The Benefits Of Breastfeeding For Your Baby 
					</h3>
					<p>					
						Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants. It has a nearly perfect mix of vitamins, protein, fat and everything your baby needs to grow. And it's all provided in a form more easily digested than infant formula. Breast milk contains antibodies that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding lowers your baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Plus, babies who are breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, without any formula, have fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses, and bouts of diarrhea. 
					
						Breastfeeding has been linked to higher IQ scores in later childhood in some studies. What's more, the physical closeness, skin-to-skin touching, and eye contact all help your baby bond with you and feel secure. Breastfed infants are more likely to gain the right amount of weight as they grow rather than become overweight children.

						Breastfeeding Benefites For The Mother 
					</h3>
					<section class="mom-emotional-benefits">
						<h4>Healthier for mother emotionally:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Increased confidence and self-esteem
							</li>
							<li>
								Breastfeeding makes travel easier. Breast milk is always clean and the right temperature.
							</li>
							<li>
								Breastfeeding mothers learn to read their 	infant’s cues and babies learn to trust caregivers. This helps shape the infant’s early behavior.
							</li>
							<li>
								Breastfeeding produces the naturally soothing hormones oxytocin and prolactin that promote stress reduction and positive feelings in the nursing mother.						
							</li>
							<li>
								Increased calmness. Breastfed babies cry less overall, and have fewer incidences of childhood illness. Breastfeeding can support the wellness of body, mind, and spirit for the whole family.						
							</li>
							<li>
								Physical/emotional bonding between mother and child is increased. Breastfeeding promotes more skin-to-skin contact, more holding and stroking. Many feel that affectionate bonding during the first years of life help reduce social and behavioral problems in both children and adults.						
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h3> Some Common Challenges With Breastfeeding</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>							
							<strong> Dry, cracked nipples. </strong> 
							Avoid soaps, perfumed creams, or lotions with alcohol in them, which can make nipples even more dry and cracked. Changing your bra pads often will help your nipples stay dry. And you should use only cotton bra pads.							
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Sore nipples. </strong> 
							You can expect some soreness in the first weeks of breastfeeding. Holding ice or a bag of frozen peas against sore nipples can temporarily ease discomfort. Keeping your nipples dry and letting them "air dry" between feedings helps, too. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Worries about producing enough milk. </strong> 
							A general rule of thumb is that a baby who's wetting six to eight diapers a day is most likely getting enough milk. Avoid supplementing your breast milk with formula, and never give your infant plain water. Some women mistakenly think they can't breastfeed if they have small breasts. But small-breasted women can make milk just as well as large-breasted women.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Pumping and storing milk. 
							</strong> You can get breast milk by hand or pump it with a breast pump.  Breast milk can be safely used within 2 days if it's stored in a refrigerator. You can freeze breast milk for up to 6 months. Don't warm up or thaw frozen breast milk in a microwave. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Breast engorgement. </strong>  
							Breast engorgement means the blood vessels in your breast have become congested. This traps fluid in your breasts and makes them feel hard, painful, and swollen. Alternate heat and cold, for instance using ice packs and hot showers, to relieve mild symptoms. It can also help to release your milk by hand or use a breast pump.
						</li>
						<li class="warning-sign">
							<strong> Warning signs. </strong> 
							Breastfeeding is a natural, healthy process. But call your doctor if 
							:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Your breasts become unusually red, swollen,hard, or sore.
						    	</li>
								<li> 
									You have unusual discharge or bleeding from your nipples.
								</li>
								<li>
									You're concerned your baby isn't gaining weight or getting enough milk.
								</li>

				<p>
					Bottle feeding has its own pros and cons. You should carefully consider both sides of the situation before settling on the method of feeding your baby. The aim is to ensure that your baby is neither underfed nor overfed and gets the essential vitamins and nutrients while she adapts to the world around her.

					<h3> The Advantages Of Bottle-feeding </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>It can be done in public :</strong> 
							Some moms are not comfortable with breastfeeding their babies in public. If you don’t want to expose your breasts or go to a private area for breastfeeding, bottle feeding is the way to go!
						</li>

						<li> 
							<strong> Anyone can feed the baby :</strong> 
							One of the benefits of bottle feeding is that either parent can feed the baby. Bottle feeding allows the siblings, father and other family members to spend some time with the newborn baby.	
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> You don't have to worry about making changes to your diet : </strong> 
							A mother who feeds formula milk to her baby doesn’t have to worry about adding specific fruits and veggies to her diet. She can eat and drink anything she likes. You can take medications without worrying about passing on chemicals on your baby.			
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> You know exactly how much your baby has eaten : </strong> 
							It isn’t easy to know how much milk your baby is drinking when you breastfeed. Bottle feeding helps you find out your baby’s daily milk intake.							
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> you don't have to worry if your breast milk supply is low : </strong>
							Many moms worry that their baby will remain underfed if their breast milk supply is insufficient. In such a case, many parents resort to bottle feeding. This ensures that your baby gets all the milk he needs to grow and develop.						
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> The mother's health condition doesn't affect the baby : </strong> 
							If the mother falls ill after childbirth or faces health issues that don’t let breastfeed, a bottle can be used to feed the baby.							
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> It doesn't interfere with your social life : </strong> 
							You can go out to dinner with your friends without worrying about expressing or getting home before feeding time.			
						</li>
					</ul>	
				</section>
				
				<section class="cons">	
					<h3> The Disadvantages Of Bottle-feeding </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong> Bottle feeding equipment is an added expense :</strong> 
							Bottle feeding your baby can be expensive. If you choose to bottle feed formula milk to your little one, you will need need to buy feeding bottles, a cleaning brush and also a steriliser. You’ll also have to invest in a good-quality breast pump or formula milk powder. All this can be an added expense to your monthly budget.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> Formula milk is not as nutritious as breast milk :</strong> 
							Breast milk has all the nutrients that your baby requires to grow and develop. It is also light on the stomach than formula milk. Bottle-feeding may increase the risk of obesity in early childhood.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> Bottle feeding can be inconvenient :</strong>
							You’ll have to carry clean bottles, formula milk, baby nipples, and other necessities while travelling. It can be troublesome to manage the things as well as the baby at the same time. Bottle feeding is also inconvenient if your baby requires midnight feeding sessions as you have to get up and prepare the milk each time.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> Preparing the milk for bottle feeding takes time and effort : </strong> 
							If you’ve habituated your baby to bottle feeding, you need to wash and sterilise the bottle, pour milk into the bottle and warm it. It’s a lot of work! Improper sterilisation can also put your infant’s health at risk.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>  Your baby may not take to formula milk :</strong> 
							For some babies, formula milk-fed from a bottle may not be suitable. They may experience diarrhoea and a loss of fluids from the body.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> Bottle-feeding may compromise your baby’s immune system : </strong> 
							Studies show that breast milk develops and improves your baby’s immune system. Formula milk, on the other hand, doesn’t contain vital and natural nutrients. Formula-fed babies also carry the risk of developing certain illnesses like a chest infection, ear infection, urine infection or diarrhoea.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> It affects the mother-baby bonding : </strong> 
							Feeding is a bonding moment for the mother and the child. When she latches on to your breasts, skin-to-skin contact is established. Bottle feeding may hamper this bonding.
