			<h3> Read books and tell stories </h3>
			<p>
				Read books and tell stories to your baby from birth, every day if you can. After a few weeks, your baby will know that this is when you enjoy a quiet, special time together.

			<h3> How do babies communicate?</h3>
			<p>
				Babies are born with the ability to cry, which is how they communicate for a while. Your baby's cries generally tell you that something is wrong: an empty belly, a wet bottom, cold feet, being tired, or a need to be held and cuddled, etc.

			<h3> Why talking with babies is important?</h3>
			<p>
				Talking with babies and children from birth is important because it builds your child’s language and communication skills. These are important skills for life. Talking with your child doesn’t have to be a big deal – just chatting about everyday things is a great start.

			<h3> Why more talk is better? </h3>
			<p>
				Talking with your baby can help his language and communication development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Parents who talk a lot to their young children use lots of 		different sounds and words. When children hear more words, it helps to improve their understanding of language, and increases the number and variety of words that they can understand and use.

		<p> 
			Your child will also learn to talk by watching how you communicate with others. If you talk in a positive way, your child will learn to speak positively to others.
